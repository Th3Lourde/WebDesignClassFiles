          I looked at awwwwards for inspiration about how to create the site. I have a new color scheme that I am playing with. The interactive part of the website requires a lot of JS which is super tedious to figure out. Thankfully I have plenty of time and know what I am doing :)<br>
          I don't currently have a plan of what I will get accomplished when. I am just working on the project when I have time and anticipate that I should have another draft finished in a couple of weeks. I hope to use transitions and have a more guided UX that explicitly tells the user what they need to do.
