        <h2>After showing a redesigned version of my website to the professor, I have opted to go with a 2-page website where the first page is a landing page for people that are using the website and the other page is where you can make the fractal. I am decreasing the number of parameters available to the user from six to three. On the landing page I am hoping to have sliders or an animation that can give the user an idea about how the different parameters affect the fractal that they are creating :)</h2>
